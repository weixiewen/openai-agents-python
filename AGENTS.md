Welcome to the OpenAI Agents SDK repository. This file contains the main points for new contributors.

## Repository overview

- **Source code**: `src/agents/` contains the implementation.
- **Tests**: `tests/` with a short guide in `tests/README.md`.
- **Examples**: under `examples/`.
- **Documentation**: markdown pages live in `docs/` with `mkdocs.yml` controlling the site.
- **Utilities**: developer commands are defined in the `Makefile`.
- **PR template**: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md` describes the information every PR must include.

## Local workflow

1. Format, lint and typeâ€‘check your changes:

   ```bash
   make format
   make lint
   make mypy
   ```

2. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   make tests
   ```

   To run a single test, use `uv run pytest -s -k <test_name>`.

3. Build the documentation (optional but recommended for docs changes):

   ```bash
   make build-docs
   ```

   Coverage can be generated with `make coverage`.

## Snapshot tests

Some tests rely on inline snapshots. See `tests/README.md` for details on updating them:

```bash
make snapshots-fix      # update existing snapshots
make snapshots-create   # create new snapshots
```

Run `make tests` again after updating snapshots to ensure they pass.

## Style notes

- Write comments as full sentences and end them with a period.

## Pull request expectations

PRs should use the template located at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md`. Provide a summary, test plan and issue number if applicable, then check that:

- New tests are added when needed.
- Documentation is updated.
- `make lint` and `make format` have been run.
- The full test suite passes.

Commit messages should be concise and written in the imperative mood. Small, focused commits are preferred.

## What reviewers look for

- Tests covering new behaviour.
- Consistent style: code formatted with `ruff format`, imports sorted, and type hints passing `mypy`.
- Clear documentation for any public API changes.
- Clean history and a helpful PR description.
